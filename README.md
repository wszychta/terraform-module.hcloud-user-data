# terraform-module.hcloud-user-data
## Description
<b>The purpose of this module is to provide ready to use user-data file for Hetzner cloud servers with multiple network managers.</b>

All actions taken to create user-data file are based on [Hetzner server configuration documentation](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/networks/server-configuration/), [Hetzner static ip documentation](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/static-configuration/), [cloud-init documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and my own experience/experiments.
